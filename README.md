<h1>Delivery App</h1>

<p>
  Delivery App is a app for a beverage distributor. This is a full stack project that was developed in group. In the construction of the 
  front end, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Context API, Axios and Jest were used. The backend was developed using Node.Js, Express, JWT, MySQL,
  Sequelize, Mocha, Chai and  Sinon. We use SCRUM practices to make our development agile and we are guided by a kanban board.

  Rafael and I were responsible for developing the front-end application. I worked on the development of all pages related to customer and seller
  interaction, as well as the login and registration pages. I also developed all the tests related to the frontend
